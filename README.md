Pseudocode:

Starting page with a h1 "Coding Quiz Challenge" instructions and start quiz button

Pressing start changes opens h2 question and a list of 4 clickable boxes with answers
    Timer is started when start is pressed with 75 seconds

Clicking an answer opens up a subtle in-window text alert under an hr line saying Correct or Wrong
    appears in a row under the content and stays on screen for ~2 seconds

Clicking an incorrect answer subtracts 15 seconds (instructions say 10 seconds, decide later)

When all questions are answered or time is out, type "Game Complete!"
    "Your final score is " + time (save time to a new score variable)

Prompt user for Initials (probably allow for letters and numbers) and submit (Possibly a form?)

Store initials and score into local storage

Text button in top left corner calls initials and score
    Possibly run an if-statement to order scores so highest appears first
